## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.precital.com/v1
```

For testing, you can use the sandbox environment:

```
https://sandbox-api.precital.com/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests (except the `/health` endpoint) require authentication using an API key. API keys are workspace-scoped and can be generated from your account settings in the Precital app.

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```http
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
```

<Info>
The workspace associated with your API key is automatically inferred - you don't need to specify it in requests.
</Info>

## Credits

All API operations consume credits from your workspace's credit balance:

- **Audio Analysis**: 1 credit per analysis
- **Lyric Analysis**: 1 credit per analysis
- **Press Release Generation**: 2 credits per press release
- **Credit Balance Check**: 0 credits (free)

If your workspace has insufficient credits, the API will return a `CREDITS_EXHAUSTED` error.
