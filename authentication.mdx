description: Learn how to authenticate API requests

## Overview

All API requests (except the `/health` endpoint) require authentication using an API key. API keys are workspace-scoped and can be generated from your account settings in the Precital app.

## Generating an API Key

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Log in to Precital**
   - Navigate to [precital.com](https://precital.com) and log in to your account

2. **Access Account Settings**
   - Click on your profile icon in the top navigation
   - Select "Account Settings" or "Settings" from the dropdown menu

3. **Navigate to API Keys Section**
   - In the account settings page, find and click on the "API Keys" section
   - This section is typically located under "Developer" or "Integrations"

4. **Generate a New API Key**
   - Click the "Generate New API Key" button
   - Optionally, provide a name/description for the key (e.g., "Production API Key", "Development Key")
   - Select the workspace to associate with the key (if you have multiple workspaces)
   - Click "Generate"

5. **Copy and Store Your API Key**
   - **Important**: The API key will be displayed only once
   - Copy the API key immediately and store it securely
   - Use a password manager or secure environment variable storage
   - **Never commit API keys to version control**

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of every request:

```http
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
```

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.precital.com/v1/credits \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_live_abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.precital.com/v1/credits', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'pk_live_abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.precital.com/v1/credits',
    headers={
        'X-API-Key': 'pk_live_abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Workspace Association

<Info>
API keys are **workspace-scoped**: each key is linked to a specific workspace. All API operations performed with a key will use credits from that workspace.
</Info>

- The workspace is automatically inferred from your API key - you don't need to specify it in requests
- If you have multiple workspaces, you can create separate API keys for each
- All resources (analyses, press releases) are scoped to your workspace

## Authentication Errors

If your API key is missing, invalid, or expired, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Authentication required. Please provide a valid API key in the X-API-Key header.",
    "doc_url": "https://docs.precital.com/errors#UNAUTHORIZED"
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

- **Use environment variables** to store API keys in your applications
- **Rotate API keys regularly** for better security
- **Revoke unused keys** to minimize attack surface
- **Use different keys** for different environments (development, staging, production)

## Managing API Keys

You can manage your API keys from your account settings:

- View all your API keys
- See creation date, last used date, and associated workspace
- Revoke or regenerate keys as needed
