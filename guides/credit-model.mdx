description: Understanding the Precital API credit system
---

## Overview

The Precital API uses a credit-based billing model. Each API operation consumes a certain number of credits from your workspace's balance.

## Credit Costs

| Operation | Credits |
|-----------|---------|
| Audio Analysis | 1 credit |
| Lyric Analysis | 1 credit |
| Press Release Generation | 2 credits |
| Credit Balance Check | 0 credits (free) |

## Workspace Credits

<Info>
Credits are workspace-scoped - each workspace has its own credit balance.
</Info>

- All API operations performed with an API key use credits from the associated workspace
- Credits are deducted immediately when an operation completes successfully
- Failed operations do not consume credits

## Checking Your Balance

Use the `/v1/credits` endpoint to check your current credit balance:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.precital.com/v1/credits \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here"
```

The response includes:
- Current credit balance
- Estimated remaining operations for each endpoint type

## Insufficient Credits

If your workspace doesn't have enough credits for an operation, the API will return a `402 Payment Required` or `400 Bad Request` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "CREDITS_EXHAUSTED",
    "message": "Insufficient credits to perform this operation",
    "details": {
      "credits_required": 1,
      "credits_available": 0
    },
    "doc_url": "https://docs.precital.com/errors#CREDITS_EXHAUSTED"
  }
}
```

## Purchasing Credits

To purchase credits:

1. Log in to your Precital account
2. Navigate to the credits purchase page
3. Select the amount of credits you want to purchase
4. Complete the payment

Credits are added to your workspace's balance immediately after purchase.

## Best Practices

<Warning>
Always check your credit balance before making API calls to avoid unexpected errors.
</Warning>

- Monitor your credit balance regularly
- Set up alerts for low credit balances
- Purchase credits proactively to avoid service interruptions
- Use the `/v1/credits` endpoint to estimate remaining operations
