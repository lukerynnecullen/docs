<ApiReference openapi="openapi.yaml" endpoint="GET /v1/credits" />

## Credit Costs

Each API operation consumes a certain number of credits:

- **Audio Analysis**: 1 credit per analysis
- **Lyric Analysis**: 1 credit per analysis
- **Press Release Generation**: 2 credits per press release
- **Credit Balance Check**: 0 credits (free)

## Checking Your Balance

Use the `/v1/credits` endpoint to check your current credit balance and see estimated remaining operations:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.precital.com/v1/credits \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.precital.com/v1/credits', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key-here'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Insufficient Credits

If your workspace doesn't have enough credits, the API will return a `402 Payment Required` or `400 Bad Request` response with a `CREDITS_EXHAUSTED` error code.
